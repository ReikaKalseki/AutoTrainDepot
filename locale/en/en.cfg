[technology-description]
basic-depot=An automated system for controlling the item flow in a train depot, allowing for the use of a centralized storage system without the risk of some items displacing space for others.
depot=More advanced depot control, allowing for dynamic train unloading and handling of more item types.
depot-fluid=Advanced fluid connectivity control, allowing for one depot to service trains with multiple liquid types, controllable on a per-wagon basis.
rapid-loading=Faster ways to quickly load trains, without risking jamming or taking large amounts of space, when used with depot controllers.
rapid-unloading=Faster ways to quickly unload trains, without risking jamming or taking large amounts of space, when used with depot controllers.
train-alarms=Automatically send warning alerts when trains reach undesired states that require manual intervention (out of fuel, deadlock, no-path, et cetera).
bypass-beacons=Allowing trains to skip stations in their route without having to close the station entirely.

[depot-power-desc]
redbar-control=Manipulating cargo wagon locked slots to prevent output-type wagons from filling at the depot
inserter-cleaning=Cleaning inserters feeding trains so they can be used for the next train with a different item type, or for multiple item types for one wagon, without jamming
balancing=Balancing the contents of all connected storages for easy car-agnostic loading
dynamic-filters=Changing input filters dynamically so that the depot automatically handles any item type on any input inserter or belt
cargo-filters=Setting train wagon filters dynamically on a per-station basis to allow wagons to carry both ingredients and products

[mod-setting-description]
block-stations=This will change the pathfinding weights for train routing logic to prevent trains from waiting behind other trains that are likely to never move, or only do so after a significant length of time (eg manual mode, parked at a station, lost without a path, etc).
